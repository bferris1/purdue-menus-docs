**What Information is Collected?**

When you enable automatic night mode and grant the location permission, the system will use your location to determine if dark mode should be enabled. Your location is never directly accessed by the app and is not collected.


Additionally, if you have elected to send Android crash reports, such reports may be provided to the developer. These reports include basic information about your device model and the crash event in order to help diagnose issues.

**How is the information used?**

Any collected information is used only to improve the app. No data is shared with third parties.
